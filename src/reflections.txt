Model:

Kinematic model

State params:
- x
- y
- psi
- v
- cross track error (CTE)
- Orientation error

Actuators:
- Steering angle delta
- Throttle/acceleration

Latency handling:

Predict state at 100ms and then feed it to solver for getting actuation values.

x = x + v*cos(psi)*latency;
y = y + v*sin(psi)*latency;
psi = psi + v*(-delta/Lf)*latency;
v = v + acceleration*latency;

Parameter tuning:

Tried different values for N and dt

1. N = 25 and dt = 0.5: Fail
2. N = 100 and dt = 0.5: Fail
3. N = 100 and dt = 0.1: Fail
4. N = 50 and dt = 0.1: Fail
5. N = 25 and dt = 0.1: Fail
6. N = 25 and dt = 0.05: Pass
